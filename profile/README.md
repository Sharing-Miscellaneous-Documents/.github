Hi everyone! This is an "organization" to share documents that are not directly related to math or physics, but might be helpful, like resources for learning other languages. (E.g.: the French repository might be useful if you're an algebraic geometer.)

(There's also other stuff that's just for fun, like the origami repository.)
